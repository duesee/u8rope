# u8rope (unusable)

This crate will provide a persistent rope based on bytes (u8).

The aim is to explore data structure design in Rust by using `std::rc::Rc`, `std::borrow::Cow`, etc. Design decisions are influenced by undo/redo functionality, lazy-loading and ease-of-use.

The crate may eventually be used for a toy hex editor.
